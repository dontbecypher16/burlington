**Web Scraper**

I would like  to scrape the data 
Export the data to a database,  maybe mongodb
To read the website and update existing data in db
Once this is done I would like to export the data to an excel sheet at predetermined dates and times

Missing values:
	• Approximate judgment(arrears) 
	• Status history


The values are missing because it's pulling from the main page instead of the Details link for each individual post


Will need to scrape Zillow as well to  lookup the Estimated Value and to check against the defendant and address
